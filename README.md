- 👋 Hi, I’m @MarcDLange, you can call me Marc.
- 👀 I’m interested in coding and video games, sometimes I combine those interests.
- 🌱 I’m currently retraining to become an Software Developer (using Python at work).
- 💞️ I'm currently not looking to collaborate on things because I'm focusing on school.

I already learned IT Specialist/Technical Assistant over 10 years ago, so I am a little bit rusty on the technical things.

I am using Python, SQL and JSON (almost) daily at work, have good self-taught skills in JavaScript and C# and also know a little bit about HTML, CSS.
