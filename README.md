- 👋 Hi, I’m @MarcDLange, you can call me Marc.
- 👀 I’m interested in coding and video games, sometimes I combine those interests.
- 🌱 I’m currently retraining to become an IT specialist for application development.
- 💞️ I'm currently not looking to collaborate on things because I'm focusing on school.

I'm already a technical assistant for IT that is currently retraining to become an IT specialist for application development.

I mainly have self-taught skills in JavaScript and C# but also know a little bit about JSON, Python, HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL, Java and C++.
